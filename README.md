# Survey form with React

I have create a survery with react, javascript, css and HTML. It's a form build with different components and showcase text input, radiobutton and dropdowns. 

## The problem

I started to plan out how to build the form. Set what kind of questions and how the order would be. 
When the plan was set I started to build a main component called "form" where I wanted to pass all my other components to so i could keep my "app" file clean. When I started with the structure in the Form file I step by step created new files to create the questions. As last I did the styling. 
The challange I had with this project is to keep track of the different files and make sure that the naming was correct and small typing errors. 

Sources I've used is: 
 Google, stackoverFlow and youtube.
